Thin and lightweight JavaScript storage interface with middleware layer. Designed for small projects.
Not necessarily scalable. Designed for simplicity. Great for DIY adapters.

## Concepts and conventions

- out of the box - run locally in-memory without any further required implementations
- all or nothing - changes rejected by middleware will not be applied at all
- bring your own - validation, cleaning, processing is all optional and done by middleware
- keep it simple - the api is minimal and easy to comprehend

## Is this package for you?

If you plan to do simple operations on some collections then this tool might be for you.
It allows to CRUD a local in-memory store and provides a minimal middleware stack that allows
to commit the changes to whatever will actually store the data.

It brings no sync or replication system but a simple API to help you with it.

### Tools / stack

We use the following stack to develop and publish this package:

* üó™ [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for transpiling
* ü™Ñ [Standard](https://standardjs.com/) for linting
* ‚öóÔ∏è [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com) for testing
* üîç [c8](https://github.com/bcoe/c8) for code coverage
* üìö [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) for documentation and [jsdoc-to-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdoc-to-markdown) to create docs as markdown files
* ‚ö° [GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for continuous integration
* üì¶ [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) for bundling

All tools are defined as **`dev-dependencies`**!

### Contributing and development (quick guide)

**Note:** We provide an [extensive contribution guideline](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and a [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
to help you in making your contribution a success!

First, or fork the repository and clone it to your local machine:

```shell

```

From here, simply create your Js files in the `./lib` folder and add the tests in the `test` folder.

We provide a default set of tools via npm scripts. Run a script via

```shell
$ npm run <command>
```

where `<command>` is one of the following available commands:

| command         | description                                       | output     |

| `lint`          | runs the linter in read-mode                      |            |
| `lint:fix`      | runs the linter; fixes minor issues automatically |            |
| `test`          | runs the tests once                               |            |
| `test:watch`    | runs the tests; re-runs them on code changes      |            |
| `test:coverage` | runs the tests once and creates a coverage report | `coverage` |
| `docs`          | creates API documentation                         | `docs`     |
| `build`         | builds the bundles for several target platforms   | `dist`     |
| `build:full`    | runs `build` and `docs`                           | see above  |
