Thin and lightweight JavaScript storage interface with middleware layer. Designed for small projects.
Not necessarily scalable. Designed for simplicity. Great for DIY adapters.

## About this package

If you plan to do simple operations on some collections then this tool might be for you.
It allows to CRUD a local in-memory store and provdies a minimal middleware stack that allows
to commit the changes to whatever will actually store the data.

It brings no sync system but a simple API to help you with it.
